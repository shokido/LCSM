# LCSM
Fortran source codes of the linear continuously stratified ocean model (LCSM; McCreary et al. 1981) written by S. Kido. If you use these codes in your publications, please cite Kido et al. (2019).


# How to use it
1. Make you own grid for calculation (see PreProcessing/GRID).
2. Prepare wind forcing and density stratification (see PreProcessing/WIND and PreProcessing/STRF)
3. Execute calcuation (see CODES/)
4. Convert output files to z-grid (see PostProcessing).
